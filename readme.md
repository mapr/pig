Apache Pig with MapR
===========
Pig is a dataflow programming environment for processing very large files. Pig's
language is called Pig Latin. A Pig Latin program consists of a directed
acyclic graph where each node represents an operation that transforms data.
Operations are of two flavors: (1) relational-algebra style operations such as
join, filter, project; (2) functional-programming style operators such as map,
reduce.

Pig compiles these dataflow programs into (sequences of) map-reduce jobs and
executes them using Hadoop. It is also possible to execute Pig Latin programs
in a "local" mode (without Hadoop cluster), in which case all processing takes
place in a single local JVM.

Getting Started
===============
1. To learn about Pig, try http://wiki.apache.org/pig/PigTutorial
2. To build and run Pig:

```bash
$ mkdir pig-mapr
$ cd pig-mapr
$ git clone git://github.com/mapr/pig.git .
$ git checkout 0.10.0-mapr
$ ant jar-withouthadoop
```
To build tests you need to copy
 http://www.eli.sdsu.edu/java-SDSU/sdsuLibJKD12.jar.

```bash
$ cd pig-mapr/lib
$ wget http://www.eli.sdsu.edu/java-SDSU/sdsuLibJKD12.jar
# purge old junit classes from sdsuLibJKD12.jar
$ zip -d sdsuLibJKD12.jar  'junit/*'
$ cd ..
$ ant test
```

Also see http://wiki.apache.org/pig/BuildPig and
http://wiki.apache.org/pig/RunPig

To build zebra,

```bash
$ cd pig-mapr/contrib/zebra
$ ant jar
```

To create a tarball corresponding to the mapr-pig package

```bash
$ cd pig-mapr
$ tar -czvf build/pig-<pig-version>-<mapr-version>.tar.gz . --exclude "build" --exclude ".git" --exclude "src-gen"
```
